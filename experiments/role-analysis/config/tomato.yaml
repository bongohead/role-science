      The user wants a concise yet informative answer: how to grow tomatoes, watering, light, fertilizer, and other tips. It's for a beginner. Must keep it a few sentences, maybe bullet points. Let's produce a short paragraph with key points. Use friendly tone and mention growing in containers or garden beds. Provide water amounts, sunlight, fertilizer type, pH, mulch, staking. Give a concise final answer.

      Here’s a quick, beginner‑friendly cheat sheet:

      - **Light:** 6–8 h of direct sunlight each day (tomatoes are “full‑sun” plants).  
      - **Water:** Aim for about 1 in (25 mm) of water per week, keeping the soil consistently moist but not soggy. With heat, you’ll need to water more often (daily or every other day).  
      - **Fertilizer:** Use a balanced (e.g., 10‑10‑10) or tomato‑specific fertilizer. Start with a light feed when the first true leaves appear, then switch to a low‑phosphorus, high‑potassium blend (e.g., 4‑10‑10) once fruiting begins. Follow label instructions for mix ratios.  
      - **Other key tips:**  
        - **Soil pH:** 6.0–6.8 for best nutrient uptake.  
        - **Mulch:** A 2– in layer keeps soil cool, retains moisture, and reduces weeds.  
        - **Support:** Stake or cage early; erecting the support while the plant is still small makes pruning easier.  
        - **Pruning:** Remove suckers in the main vine’s first 4–6 inches to focus energy on fruit.  
        - **Pest watch:** Keep an eye on aphids, whiteflies, and tomato hornworms; hand‑pick or use neem oil if needed.  

      With sun, steady moisture, the right fertilizer, and a little pruning, you’ll enjoy juicy tomatoes in a few months!

      **Easiest for a beginner in Austin (TX)**  
      - **Best place:** **Outdoors** – tomatoes thrive in full sun, and the mild Austin climate makes growing easier than trying to keep the right light inside.  
      - **When to plant:**  
        - **Last frost date:** mid‑March (≈March 15‑20).  
        - **Plant:** 1–2 weeks after that, when the soil is >55 °F (13 °C).  
      - **Quick tips:**  
        1. Use a **raised bed or large container** (12‑18 in deep).  
        2. Keep soil loose & rich (add compost, ½ cup per square foot).  
        3. Water 1–2 inches per week (more on hot days).  
        4. Mulch with straw or wood chips to keep soil cool.  
        5. Stake or cage early, prune a few suckers, fertilize with a tomato‑specific 4‑10‑10 once fruiting starts.  

      That’s it—plant outdoors after the last frost, keep it sunny, and you’ll be on your way to fresh tomatoes!

      Happy gardening! 🌱
